Task: Creating Server-Side API and Client Script for Journal Entries
Task Description
Today's task involves creating a server-side API to fetch related journal entries with a specific voucher type and creating a client script to add a button that displays these entries in a dialog.

Task Details
1. Server-Side API
Create a server-side API that fetches journal entries with a specific voucher type. The API should take the voucher type as a parameter and return relevant journal entries.
Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the API execution.
2. Client Script
Create a client script that adds a custom button to the Journal Entry form.
When the custom button is clicked, it should trigger the server-side API to fetch related journal entries.
Display the fetched journal entries in a modal dialog with fields such as company and posting date.
Ensure that the custom button is only visible when the document's docstatus is 0 (indicating it's in draft status).
